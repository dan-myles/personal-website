# Exploring Expo, React Native, and SST (And why I don't like Firebase)

##### March 3rd, 2025

## Expo

If you're a React dev looking to jump into mobile development without the hassle, Expo is your best buddy.
Expo makes React Native a breeze to work with by streamlining the setup and development process.
Not only does it simplify configuration, but it also provides a robust set of tools that let you
focus on building amazing apps instead of wasting time with complicated setups.
And for those who love a neat design, pairing Expo with Tailwind (or its React Native counterpart, NativeWind)
brings that fantastic developer experience to mobile projects. Imagine creating stylish,
responsive interfaces with the same ease as web development — it's like having your cake and eating it too,
with a little extra bounce in your step.

## SST

Now, let’s talk backend — because even the fanciest frontend needs a reliable partner in crime.
I’m not the biggest fan of Firebase and other out-of-the-box BaaS solutions;
they’re easy to misconfigure and often lead to unexpected surprises.
Enter SST: a mature project crafted by a team of competent developers.
With SST, deploying massive infrastructure becomes straightforward and reliable.
You can get serverless functions up and running in no time,
and integrating a full backend is a piece of cake.
And the cherry on top? SST makes deploying and managing serverless
architectures on AWS a far more enjoyable experience,
keeping me from reaching for Firebase as frequently as I used to.
It's refreshing and smart — like a breath of fresh air in the sometimes overwhelming landscape of cloud services.

## Conclusion

In the fast-paced world of app development, tools like Expo and SST are game-changers.
Expo simplifies the creation of robust React Native apps with a clean DX (Developer Experience),
especially when paired with the magic of Tailwind or NativeWind.
SST, on the other hand, steps in to save the day on the backend,
offering a mature, efficient, and straightforward way to handle massive infrastructure
deployments and serverless functions. While I have a soft spot for AWS
and enjoy the learning curve it brings, moving away from Firebase's shaky
BaaS model has been liberating. Embrace these tools,
streamline your workflow, and enjoy a smoother journey from code to cloud!
